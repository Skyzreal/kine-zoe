# Stripe Integration Setup (Redirect Flow)

## Overview

Your Stripe integration uses the **redirect flow** instead of webhooks for maximum simplicity and reliability. Everything happens when the customer returns from Stripe Checkout.

### âœ… Completed Features

1. **Server-side Integration**
   - Stripe payment session creation
   - Payment verification with automatic booking completion
   - Calendar integration immediately after payment verification
   - Confirmation email sent during verification

2. **Client-side Integration**
   - Stripe service with proper error handling
   - Payment form component
   - Success page with session verification
   - Cancel page for cancelled payments
   - Environment configuration service

3. **New Components Created**
   - `StripeService` - Handles all Stripe operations
   - `EnvironmentService` - Manages API keys and URLs
   - Enhanced `Success` page with payment verification
   - New `Cancel` page for payment cancellations

## ðŸ”§ Setup Required

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with your Stripe keys:

```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_actual_secret_key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_publishable_key
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:4200
PORT=3000
```

**Note**: No webhook configuration needed! ðŸŽ‰

### 2. Update Client Configuration

The publishable key is already configured in:
`client/src/app/shared/services/environment.service.ts:8`

Update it with your actual key if needed.

## ðŸš€ How It Works (Redirect Flow)

### Payment Flow

1. **Customer fills form** â†’ `confirmation-info` component
2. **Stripe Checkout created** â†’ Backend creates payment session
3. **Redirect to Stripe** â†’ Customer completes payment
4. **Return to success page** â†’ Payment verification happens automatically
5. **Booking completed** â†’ Calendar updated + email sent server-side
6. **Success displayed** â†’ Customer sees confirmation

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/create-payment-session` - Creates Stripe checkout session
- `GET /api/verify-payment/:sessionId` - Verifies payment + completes booking
- `POST /api/update-calendar` - Manual calendar updates (if needed)
- `POST /api/send-confirmation-email` - Manual email sending (if needed)

### Frontend Routes

- `/confirmer` - Payment form and client information
- `/success` - Payment success with verification
- `/cancel` - Payment cancellation page

## ðŸ’° Pricing Configuration

Currently set to $100 CAD (10000 cents). Update in:
`client/src/app/pages/services/confirmation-info/confirmation-info.ts:31`

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test Mode

Use Stripe test cards:
- Success: `4242424242424242`
- Decline: `4000000000000002`

### Test the Flow

1. Start both servers:
   ```bash
   # Server
   cd server && npm start
   
   # Client  
   cd client && npm start
   ```

2. Navigate to `/confirmer`
3. Fill out the form
4. Use test card numbers
5. Verify success/cancel pages work
6. Check server logs for calendar/email confirmation

## âœ… Advantages of Redirect Flow

- **No webhook configuration** required
- **Immediate booking completion** when customer returns
- **Simpler deployment** - no webhook endpoint to secure
- **More reliable** - doesn't depend on webhook delivery
- **Easier testing** - works in development without tunneling

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- All sensitive keys are in environment variables
- Payment sessions are validated server-side
- CORS is configured for your domain
- No webhook secrets needed

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Set up your Stripe account** and get real API keys
2. **Test the complete flow** with test cards
3. **Update pricing** as needed
4. **Customize email templates** in the server code
5. **Deploy to production** with real environment variables

Your Stripe integration is production-ready once you configure the API keys! ðŸš€
